### Hi ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm a full-stack developer based in the United Kingdom. I often work with JavaScript, PHP and Rust to build my applications and frameworks like React to build my UX/UI; I also collaborate with and develop blockchain projects where I primarily use Solidity to develop ERC721 Contracts and create applications that are on Web 3.0.

I'm a staunch advocate for privacy and open-source, so you can find most of my projects on my GitHub as well as on my <a href="https://0x88.dev/portfolio" target="_blank"> portfolio</a>.
